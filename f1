Messi is the only player to top-score in four consecutive Champions League seasons
and also holds the record for the most hat-tricks scored in the competition with five. 
In March 2012, he made Champions League history by becoming the first player to 
score five goals in one match. In the 2011–12 season, Messi set the European record 
for most goals scored in a season with 73 goals, set the goalscoring record in a 
single La Liga season with 50 goals, and became the second player ever to score in 
six different official competitions in one season after Pedro. In February 2013 
he scored his 300th Barcelona goal. On 30 March 2013, Messi scored in his 19th 
consecutive La Liga game, becoming the first footballer in history to net in 
consecutive matches against every team in a professional football league. He extended 
his record scoring streak to 21 consecutive league matches. In March 2014, with a 
hat-trick against Real Madrid, Messi became the player with the most goals and most 
hat-tricks in the history of El Clásico. In October 2014, Messi, aged 27, became the 
youngest player to score 250 goals in La Liga. In November 2014, Messi scored a hat-trick 
against Sevilla to reach 253 La Liga goals, becoming the all-time top scorer in 
La Liga. In May 2015, he scored his 77th Champions League goal to become its all-time leading scorer.
